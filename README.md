# murderdata

The Murder Accountability Project is a nonprofit organization that compiles U.S. homicide data from the FBI and local governments. Their mission is to educate the public about the unsolved murder problem in the United States, and to provide the most complete data on homicides in one place so local police departments can solve cold cases.

This open exploratory analysis seeks to find trends and insights in the data, and to shine a light upon how much is unknown/unsolved when it comes to homicide in the U.S. 

This project uses publicly available homicide data from the [Murder Accountability Project](https://www.murderdata.org) and population data from the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov)
